# image-spam-email-detector
Working on enhancing existing image spam email detection ML algorithms using existing public dataset as well as augmented datasets
Image spam problems have been around for quite a while now. A lot have since been done but there yet remain room for more improvement as the domain remains quite dynamic.
I intend to achieve a model that becomes a true life long image spam email detector.
